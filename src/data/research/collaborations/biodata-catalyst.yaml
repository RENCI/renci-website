  In partnership with RTI International, RENCI facilitates coordination among the partners and platforms powering the NHLBI BioData Catalyst ecosystem. 

  By increasing access to NHLBI datasets and innovative data analysis capabilities, BioData Catalyst accelerates efficient biomedical research that drives discovery and scientific advancement, leading to novel diagnostic tools, therapeutics and prevention strategies for heart, lung, blood, and sleep disorders. The ecosystem is a dynamic resource that allows researchers to find, access, share, store, and compute on large scale datasets. 

  Though the primary goal of the BioData Catalyst project is to build a data science platform, at its core, this is a people-centric endeavor. The Coordinating Center is in place to support BioData Catalyst as a community working to collaboratively solve technical and scientific challenges.
