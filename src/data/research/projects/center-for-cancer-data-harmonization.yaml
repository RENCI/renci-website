  The Center for Cancer Data Harmonization (CCDH) aims to make the volumes of data arising from cancer research more accessible, organized, and powerful.

  [CCDH](https://datascience.cancer.gov/data-commons/center-cancer-data-harmonization-ccdh) will work with a cloud-based data-sharing portal called the Cancer Research Data Commons to improve access and use of cancer research data. The Commons is designed to integrate and structure disparate types of data—generated by everything from basic science studies to clinical trials—in ways that help researchers make advances and clinicians provide the best treatments.
 
  The center’s work is organized around five key areas: community development, data model harmonization, ontology and terminology ecosystem, tools and data quality, and program management. RENCI contributes expertise in incorporating ontologies into tools for data validation, harmonization, and quality control.
