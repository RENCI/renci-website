  Scientists face numerous challenges when integrating data from multiple scientific instruments and data stores into their workflows. The Delivering a Dynamic Network-Centric Platform for Data-Driven Science (DyNamo) project helps increase scientific productivity through a platform that manages high-performance data flows and coordinates access to cyberinfrastructure.

  RENCI leads the DyNamo project, which aims to develop a network-centric platform to enable high performance, adaptive data flows and coordinated access to cyberinfrastructure facilities and data repositories for researchers in adaptive weather sensing and ocean sciences.
 
  While recent advances in dynamic, networked cloud infrastructures like NSF GENI and Software Defined Networking (SDN) provide the building blocks to construct integrated, reconfigurable, end-to-end infrastructure, scientific applications and workflows have seldom taken advantage of these advanced capabilities. By leveraging prior work in programmatic control of dynamic infrastructure and novel SDN-aware network services, DyNamo develops new algorithms, policies, and mechanisms in a novel network-centric platform.
   
  DyNamo will:
  - Enable programmable, on-demand access to high-bandwidth, configurable network paths from community data repositories to national cyberinfrastructure facilities.
  - Engage with domain scientists from the Collaborative & Adaptive Weather Sensing (CASA) and Ocean Observatory Initiative (OOI) communities to bridge the gap between data-driven, observational science workflows and novel network mechanisms and services.
  - Help satisfy data, computational and storage requirements of CASA and OOI workflows, enabling researchers to test new algorithms and models in real time with live streaming data.
  - Enhance interactions between Pegasus, the network-centric platform, and new network-aware workflow scheduling algorithms in Pegasus.
