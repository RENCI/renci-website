  Per and polyfluoroalkyl (PFAS) substances are chemicals used in the production of non-stick surfaces, fire suppression foams, and other products and processes. After these chemicals were found in North Carolina’s Cape Fear River, the NC General Assembly allocated funds to create a research network focused on identifying PFAS in air and water across the state, understanding its potential health impacts, and informing remediation and risk communication. 

  RENCI co-leads the project’s data science team, which is responsible for creating the data curation and dissemination cyberinfrastructure, along with collaborators at North Carolina State University.
