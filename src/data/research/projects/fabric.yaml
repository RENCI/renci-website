  [FABRIC](https://fabric-testbed.net/) is a nationwide testbed for reimagining how data can be stored, computed, and moved through shared infrastructure. This unique research infrastructure is designed to enable cutting-edge research in networking, cybersecurity, distributed computing and storage systems, machine learning, and science applications.

  As the lead institution on this $20 million project, RENCI is contributing to all aspects of [FABRIC](https://fabric-testbed.net/).
 
  FABRIC is being designed as an everywhere-programmable, nationwide instrument composed of novel extensible network elements equipped with large amounts of compute and storage, interconnected by high speed, dedicated optical links. It will connect a number of specialized testbeds (5G/IoT PAWR, NSF Clouds) and high-performance computing facilities to create a rich fabric for a wide variety of experimental activities.

  FABRIC will allow scientists to explore what a new Internet could look like at scale, and help determine the internet architecture of the future. The team takes a multidisciplinary approach to supporting end users as well as science domains that depend on large-scale intelligent networks.

  To advance cybersecurity, FABRIC will enable at-scale, more realistic research by peering with production networks to observe behavior. It will also integrate high-performance computing, wireless, and Internet of Things functionality to create a diverse environment combining programmable core and edge networks, large computational resources, and multiple computing capabilities including machine learning and artificial intelligence.
