  Infrastructure for Privacy-Assured CompuTations ([ImPACT](https://cyberimpact.us/)) enables scientists to share and analyze data across institutional boundaries while keeping data safe and in regulatory compliance.

  Scientific progress requires multi-institutional and cross-disciplinary sharing and analysis of data. [ImPACT](https://cyberimpact.us/) aims to help researchers spend less time thinking about security and more time advancing science by lowering the barriers that impede researchers from using privacy-restricted data in collaborative settings.  

  As project lead, RENCI collaborates with a diverse team of partners to advance an integrative model for management of trust by deploying a collection of supportive mechanisms at scale into a model cyberinfrastructure. The project develops methodologies and software with best practices in networking, data management, security, and privacy preservation to fit a variety of [use cases](https://cyberimpact.us/services/use-cases/).
