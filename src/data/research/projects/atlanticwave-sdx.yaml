  AtlanticWave-SDX helps domain scientists and network engineers around the world take advantage of Open Exchange Points (OXPs), which connect multiple networks for large-scale, data-intensive research and engineering applications.

  The AtlanticWave-SDX (AW-SDX) project is creating a new way for domain scientists and network engineers to use OXPs to support science workflows. RENCI is responsible for developing, testing, and deploying a distributed software defined exchange controller software, which links a large number of data sources and scientific users to advanced distributed OXPs.
   
  The project, led by Florida International University, aims to provision flexible inter-domain services through a single user-friendly interface. To achieve this, the AMPATH OXP in Miami, SOX OXP in Atlanta, AndesLight OXP in Santiago, Chile, and SouthernLight OXP in Sao Paulo, Brazil were evolved to become Software-Defined Exchange (SDX) points. The new AW-SDX network infrastructure along with the SDX controller will further evolve these exchange points toward an open, innovative platform while enhancing their production capacity and service capabilities.
   
  This project is designed to serve the needs of large-scale international science drivers including the Vera Rubin Observatory (a large optical telescope under construction in northern Chile), High Luminosity LHC Challenge and HEPiX, and the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), among others.
