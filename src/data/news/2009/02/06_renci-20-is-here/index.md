</a>We have redesigned our website in order to give our users a web presence that is robust, interactive, visually interesting and takes full advantage of social networking tools.

The new site prominently features RENCI-produce video, scientific images and animations. All videos are included on our YouTube site, while photos are available via Flickr. A new RENCI Facebook site allows Facebook users to become friends of RENCI and receive regular updates, and users also can follow RENCI on Twitter. A blog role with RSS feed, featuring several new RENCI blogs, offers insight on technology issues and information about RENCI events and projects. The site also makes it simple to share news items with others or to comment on any of our web content.

We invite you to explore and we welcome your feedback: <a href="mailto:webmaster@renci.org">webmaster at renci.org</a>.
