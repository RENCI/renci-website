Jones will discuss how computing and networking are ubiquitous aspects of 21st century life and culture and have fueled a global passion to understand events past, present, and future. His talk will explore ways in which technology is used to meet this quest for understanding and the impacts of living in a world made smaller by technological tools. Jones will also address the wide ranging effects of technologies that span the breadth of human experience.

"Google and Google Earth have used computing, networking and geographic information systems in ways that are transforming education, research and business" said Alan Blatecky, RENCI's interim director. “The impacts of these applications and technologies are creating new opportunities across the globe and already have redefined how some people work and play.”

As chief technology advocate for Google, Jones advances the technology and organizes the profusion of information available through Google to make it accessible and useful. He travels the globe to meet and speak with representatives of governments, businesses, Google partners and customers in order to advance the company's mission and technology. Previously, he was the chief technologist of Google Maps, Earth, and Local Search—the teams responsible for providing location intelligence and information in global context to users worldwide.

Jones served as CTO of the Keyhole Corporation, the company that developed the technology used today in Google Earth, which was acquired by Google. He was also CEO of Intrinsic Graphics, and earlier, was director of advanced graphics at Silicon Graphics. He is a prolific inventor and computer programmer, and has developed scientific and interactive computer graphics software.

The one-hour lecture is free and open to the general public, but attendees must register on the RENCI website.
