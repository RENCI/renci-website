RENCI researchers and their collaborators are continually producing technical results as a result of projects with collaborators in high performance computing, grid computing, networking infrastructure development and other areas.

As a way to share results with its key audiences, RENCI introduced a Technical Reports series in 2008. The reports show interim and final results of long-term research projects and address a wide range of issues in technical fields.
Technical reports will be listed by year and number. Check out the first two reports at http://www.renci.org/publications/techreports.php.
