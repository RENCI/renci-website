The National Science Board has approved a resolution authorizing the National Science Foundation (NSF) to fund the acquisition and deployment of the world's most powerful "leadership-class" supercomputer.

<!--more-->

The NSB has recommended that NSF select the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), in collaboration with IBM, the Great Lakes Consortium for Petascale Computation, and partners around the country to design, deploy, and operate this petascale system, pending final approval of the decision by NSF, which is expected in late summer or early fall. RENCI is a member of the Great Lakes Consortium for Petascale Computation.  For more information, please see the NSF<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=109850&amp;org=OCI&amp;from=news" target="_blank"> press release</a>.
