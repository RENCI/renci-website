At the Microsoft Research Faculty Summit, held July 16 in Redmond, WA, a panel of experts from academia, government, and Microsoft Research discussed the role of multidisciplinary research powered by computing in maintaining the U.S. position as the world's number one innovation leader. Panelists were RENCI's Dan Reed, Craig Mundie, chief research and strategy officer of Microsoft'sÂ  Advanced Strategies and Policy division; Rick Rashid, senior vice president, Microsoft Research; and Jeannette Wing, assistant director for the National Science Foundation's Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) directorate. Ed Lazowska, Bill and Melinda Gates Chair in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington, moderated the discussion.



The panelists' message: the nature of computing is changing rapidly and dramatically and partners in academia and business must embrace new collaborations, new approaches and more innovative, higher risk projects. The panel also discussed the need for simplified visa processes for graduate students, the good and bad of tenure and the need for a greater emphasis on diversity and inclusion.
