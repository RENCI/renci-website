Chapel Hill, NC—Full-time faculty at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill are invited to collaborate with the Renaissance Computing Institute (RENCI) through the RENCI Faculty Fellows Program.

<!--more-->

The RENCI Faculty Fellows program gives UNC-Chapel Hill faculty the opportunity to partner with RENCI in order to explore new research opportunities and directions; translate new ideas into technology prototypes; develop new community service or educational programs; or develop interdisciplinary projects that integrate the arts or humanities with science.

Fellowships of one academic year or one semester will begin either in the summer or fall 2007 semester. Proposals must be submitted by April 1.

Fellows will receive up to $50,000 in support and will have access to RENCI high-performance computing, storage, visualization and data management/analysis capabilities as well as sensor and hardware prototyping resources. They will work with RENCI staff and research scientists to realize the goals outlined in their proposals and will have resources to explore and develop new opportunities and multidisciplinary projects. Fellows will be expected to spend a portion of their time in residence at RENCI and to be actively involved with RENCI during their appointment.

Please read the RENCI Faculty Fellows Call for Proposals and submit completed proposals by April 1 to Margaret Buedel (<a href="mailto:buedel@renci.org">buedel@renci.org</a>).  All those who submit will be notified of acceptance by May 15. For question or clarifications, please contact RENCI Deputy Director Alan Blatecky at <a href="mailto:alan@renci.org">alan@renci.org</a> or 919-445-9643.
