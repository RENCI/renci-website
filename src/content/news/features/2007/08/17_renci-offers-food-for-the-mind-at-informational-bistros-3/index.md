Chapel Hill, NC, August 17, 2007 – The public is invited to feed their minds—as well as their stomachs—at the Renaissance Computing Institute's Renaissance Bistros. RENCI has scheduled two bistros, informal informational sessions to discuss RENCI focus areas, in September, which will focus on disaster research, including collaborations with the state of North Carolina on hurricane and storm surge prediction and disaster planning and mitigation. Both bistros are free and open to the public.



"North Carolina is third to Florida and Texas in the number of hurricanes that have had made landfall over the last 80 years," said Jessica Proud, RENCI meteorologist and speaker for the Bistro sessions. "The Renaissance Bistros will discuss the basics of hurricanes, why they form, their potential dangers, and RENCI's work to help the state deal with them effectively"

The Renaissance Bistro sessions are scheduled for:
