With many large data sets, place is an important component. From the emergency manager looking for the best evacuation route to the historian trying to understand urban development patterns over the years, people rely on geographically referenced data to meet a variety of research, business, and government needs.

RENCIâ€™s Geoanalytics platform provides intuitive, map-based visualizations to help transform data into decisions. Among other applications, this free, open source software has been used to inform disaster response, study the spread of disease, and increase the accessibility of public records.
