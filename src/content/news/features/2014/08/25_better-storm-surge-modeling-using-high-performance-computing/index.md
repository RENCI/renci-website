When hurricanes or tropical storms head toward the North Carolina coast, RENCI’s Dell PowerEdge cluster, called Hatteras, springs into action, producing finely-detailed models of possible storm tracks and resulting coastal storm surge several times a day.

A recent upgrade to Hatteras means more capacity to produce  a large number of storm surge forecast ensembles and high-resolution models in less than three hours. The effort to upgrade Hatteras was documented in a recent case study developed by Dell.
