CHAPEL HILL, NC, and SANTA BARBARA, CA - Open Science for Synthesis is a unique bi-coastal training opportunity offered for early career scientists who want to learn new software and technology skills needed for open, collaborative, and reproducible synthesis research.

UC Santa Barbara's National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) and University of North Carolina's Renaissance Computing Institute (RENCI) will co-lead the three-week intensive training workshop with participants in both Santa Barbara, CA, and Chapel Hill, NC.

The workshop will run July 21 – August 8, 2014.

Participants will receive hands-on guided experience using best practices in the technical aspects that underlie successful open science and synthesis – from data discovery and integration to analysis and visualization, and special techniques for collaborative scientific research, including virtual collaboration over the Internet.

The training will weave together several core themes using a mixture of instructive lectures, discussions, and exercises. These themes will be reinforced –  and injected into the real-time synthetic scientific research process –  through daily work on group synthesis projects. Core themes will address:
<ul>
	<li>Collaboration modes and technologies, virtual collaboration</li>
	<li>Data management, preservation, and sharing</li>
	<li>Data manipulation, integration, and exploration</li>
	<li>Scientific workflows and reproducible research</li>
	<li>Agile and sustainable software practices</li>
	<li>Data analysis and modeling</li>
	<li>Communicating results to broad communities</li>
</ul>
<b>How to Apply</b>

Applicants should be early-career researchers, defined as students in the final stages of graduate work or researchers who received their PhDs within the last five years. Attendees from outside the U.S. are welcome. Applications are available online in the <a href="https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/OSS#how-to-apply" target="_blank">How to Apply</a> section of the workshop web page.

Applications must be received by April 10, 2014.

Open Science for Synthesis is sponsored by the Institute for Sustainable Earth and Environmental Software (ISEES) and the Water Science Software Institute (WSSI), two National Science Foundation projects that are developing concepts for institutes for sustainable scientific software. The workshop collaboration was born out of the shared mission of the two sustainable software institute conceptualization efforts and is modeled after NCEAS' successful Summer Institute 2013.
