<p>Portland, OR—The Renaissance Computing Institute (RENCI) will offer a look at leading edge technologies that enable research, decision making and collaboration in its exhibit at SC09, the international conference for high performance computing, networking, storage and analysis.<!--more--></p>

<p>The conference will be held Nov. 14 – 20 at the Oregon Convention Center in Portland. RENCI will occupy space on the exhibit floor (part of booth 1835) 7 p.m. – 9 p.m. Monday, Nov. 16; 10 a.m. – 6 p.m. Tuesday, Nov. 17 and Wednesday, Nov. 18; and 10 a.m. – 4 p.m. Thursday, Nov. 19. All times are Pacific Standard Time.</p>

<p>Content from RENCI researchers and from partners at North Carolina State University, Duke University, UNC Chapel Hill and RENCI’s engagement center at UNC Charlotte will be featured in the booth. NC State and RENCI researchers will explain how NC State’s Virtual Computing Lab (VCL), a research and education cloud, is being used by research teams and educators on the NC State campus and beyond. The presentation will take place at 7 p.m. Monday, Nov. 16, and at 2:30 p.m. Tuesday, Nov. 17.</p>

<p>A research group led by UNC Chapel Hill computer science professor Dinesh Manocha will present a live remote demonstration from their campus research lab at 11:30 a.m. Tuesday, Nov. 17.  The demonstration will show how the group uses the parallel capabilities of multi-core and many-processor systems to simulate the activities of a crowd in complex, real environments. The demonstration will use a RENCI-developed multi-touch table to display a simulation of crowd activity and to show how the simulation and the multi-touch interface can be used to plan evacuations and manage large crowds.</p>

<p>Also presenting a live remote demonstration using a multi-touch table will be Jeff Michael, director of the UNC Charlotte Urban Institute and of RENCI at UNC Charlotte, and Bill Ribarsky, director of the Charlotte Visualization Center at UNC Charlotte. The two will present the Urbanization Explorer, an interactive tool used on the multi-touch table to help decision makers understand the potential impacts of urban growth. The researchers will present data on the Charlotte region’s growth since 1976, displayed as interactive maps on the multi-touch table. Users can use their fingers to zoom, pan, and navigate, and to grab a variety of on-screen tools. The demonstration will take place at 10:30 a.m. Thursday, Nov. 19.</p>
