iRODS Consortium Executive Director Jason Coposky and Chief Technologist Terrell Russell were interviewed on the Research, Computing & Engineering Podcast in an episode published on Jan. 27.

[iRODS](https://irods.org/), an acronym for the integrated Rule-Oriented Data System, is open source data management software used by research organizations, businesses, and government agencies around the world. iRODS works by virtualizing data storage resources so that users can access and control their data regardless of the location of the data's storage. RENCI is home to the iRODS development team and the iRODS Consortium, the membership organization that supports the continued development of iRODS.

[Research Computing and Engineering](http://www.rce-cast.com/) (RCE) focuses on creating podcasts that address issues in high performance computing (HPC) and research that is data intensive or requires the use of HPC resources. RCE is hosted by Brock Palen, an HPC administrator for the Center for Advanced Computing in the College of Engineering at the University of Michigan, and Jeff Squyres, a software engineer for Cisco Systems, Inc. who focuses on HPC and message passing interface (MPI).
