Graduate students interested in new media technologies and their impact on art, culture, science, commerce and the environment will convene on the Duke University campus June 7 and 8 to discuss the latest research in the field and new uses for technology in scholarship. <!--more-->

"Thinking Through New Media: 2006 Graduate Student Conference" is sponsored by the Renaissance Computing Institute (RENCI), the <a href="http://hastac.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Humanities, Arts, Sciences, and Technology Advanced Collaboratory</a> (HASTAC), and Duke University Information Science and Information Studies (ISIS). Events will be held at the John Hope Franklin Center for Interdisciplinary and International Studies, 2204 Erwin Road, Durham, NC. The conference seeks to build a graduate student community around new media scholarship and to introduce participants to HASTAC (pronounced “haystack”), ISIS, and RENCI, a joint institute of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Duke and North Carolina State University.

Students traveling from outside the Triangle area may apply for scholarships to subsidize their travel and lodging expenses. All scholarship applications must be received by Sunday, May 7.
