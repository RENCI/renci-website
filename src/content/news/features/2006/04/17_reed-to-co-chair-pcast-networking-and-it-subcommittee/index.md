RENCI Director Daniel A. Reed will serve as co-chair of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) subcommittee on Networking and Information Technology. The group will examine U.S. global IT competitiveness as well as social, economic and workforce issues. It also will take an in-depth look at the work of the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) program, the multi-agency federal IT R&amp;D effort. 

Reed will co-chair the subcommittee with George M. Scalise, who is president of the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) and directs a staff focused on international trade and government affairs, workforce, technology, environmental safety and health, and communications.

PCAST advises the president on technology, scientific research priorities, and math and science education. Its members are national leaders in business, research and education. Reed was named to PCAST in February, when President Bush expanded the group in order to better address IT issues that had been the domain of the President's Information Technology Advisory Committee (PITAC). PITAC's federal charter expired last June. Reed had been a member of PITAC and chaired its subcommittee on computational science.
