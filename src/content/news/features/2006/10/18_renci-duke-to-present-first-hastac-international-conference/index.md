The Humanities, Arts, Science and Technology Advanced Collaboratory (HASTAC, pronounced “haystack”) will hold its first international conference April 19 – 21, 2007, in Durham, NC.

The conference, titled <em>Electronic Techtonics: Thinking at the Interface</em>, will be one of the culminating events of HASTAC’s In|Formation Year, which began last June and runs through May 2007. In|Formation Year events include a series of networked discussions, lectures and performances hosted by HASTAC member institutions that highlight the human and humane dimensions of advanced technology. <!--more-->
