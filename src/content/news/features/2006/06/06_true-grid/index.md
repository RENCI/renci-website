Lavanya Ramakrishnan has seen her grid computing focus shift from security to scientific applications over the past four years. After finishing her Masters degree at Indiana University in 2002, she continued her work in grid security at MCNC before moving to the newly-formed Renaissance Computing Institute in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where she jumped feet-first into the world of scientific applications.
