Dan Reed, director of the Renaissance Computing Institute, is among the newest fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

The association is honoring Reed for his "outstanding research in the field of high performance computing, exemplary professional leadership, and distinguished national service." He becomes a fellow of the AAAS section on information, computing and communication.<!--more-->

In addition to his RENCI duties, Reed is vice chancellor for information technology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Chancellor's Eminent Professor at UNC-Chapel Hill. He founded RENCI in 2004 after serving as director of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications and as head of the computer science department at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Reed is a member of the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) and the current chair of the Board of Directors of the Computing Research Association (CRA). He served on President Bush's Information Technology Advisory Committee, where he chaired the computational science subcommittee. Reed is a member of the Biomedical Informatics Expert Panel for the National Institutes of Health's National Center and chairs the policy board for the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, the Department of Energy's high performance computing center for scientific research.

Election as a Fellow of AAAS is an honor bestowed upon members by their peers. Fellows are recognized for meritorious efforts to advance science or its applications. Nominations undergo review by the steering groups of the association's sections. New Fellows were elected by the AAAS Council in October. They will be recognized for their contributions to science and technology at the Fellows Forum on February 17, 2007, during the AAAS Annual Meeting in San Francisco.
