<p>CHAPEL HILL, NC—Graduate students, post-docs and faculty and industry professionals can participate in summer programs offered by the Virtual School of Computational Science and Engineering (VSCSE) free of charge at RENCI (the Renaissance Computing Institute), 100 Europa Dr., Chapel Hill. <!--more--></p>

<p>RENCI will host two VSCSE summer courses:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.vscse.org/summerschool/2010/petascale.html" target="_blank">Petascale Programming Environments and Tools, July 6 - 9</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.vscse.org/summerschool/2010/manycore.html" target="_blank">Proven Algorithmic Techniques for Many-core Processors, Aug. 2 - 6</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The $100 registration fee has been waived to attend the VSCSE at RENCI. RENCI is the only VSCSE site in North Carolina.  Registration allows students to fully interact with other sites and with instructors, participate in hands-on lab activities and access high performance computing resources. Certificates will be awarded to all students who complete a course.</p>

<p>Lunches and snacks  will be provided as part of the full-day class sessions. Students will be expected to pay their own travel and lodging costs. The RENCI website provides a list of nearby accommodations to assist attendees.</p>

<p>To participate in summer courses, prospective students must first be enrolled in the Virtual School. Enrollment is free and can be completed at https://hub.vscse.org/. After enrolling, students can register for courses (note: simply ignore the request for payment and do not provide your credit card information). On-site enrollment is limited to 40 students per class and students will be accepted on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>

<p>The VSCSE helps graduate students, post-docs and young professionals from all disciplines and institutions across the country gain the skills they need to use advanced computational resources to advance their research. Support for the Virtual School is provided by the Great Lakes Consortium for Petascale Computation, the National Science Foundation, the state of Illinois, the Committee on Institutional Cooperation and Internet2 Commons.</p>

<p>For questions related to on-site courses offered at RENCI, please send email to vscse@renci.org.  For directions to RENCI, see the RENCI website.</p>
