The festival, a collaboration between ECU and Go-Science, a not-for-profit organization that provides interactive science activities for children and adults, was part of the statewide North Carolina Science Festival, which included science-based activities and events across the state from Sept. 11 through Sept. 26. More than 2,000 people attended the Eastern NC Festival, which featured 25 exhibitors, including RENCI at ECU, the ECU Division of Research and Graduate Studies, and the ECU Center for Science, Math and Technology Education.

The RENCI at ECU display featured information on the center's work related to coastal erosion, coastal storm surge, bio-visualization and K - 12 informal education. The RENCI Outreach Vehicle for Education and Research (ROVER) also was on display and amateur radio operators demonstrated the radios that were installed in the ROVER.
