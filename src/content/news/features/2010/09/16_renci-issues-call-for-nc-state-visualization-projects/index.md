<p>RENCI at North Carolina State University seeks NC State faculty members and researchers to participate in the center's inaugural Program in Applied Scientific and Information Visualization.</p>

<p>Two researchers or research team will be selected for the one-year program and will have the opportunity to work directly with RENCI experts and use advanced visualization technologies and tools to enhance their research. Each awardee will receive a stipend to support their work of $10,000 to $12,000.</p>

<p>The program is open to researchers in all domains and disciplines who are conducting research projects that could benefit by using advanced scientific visualization or visual analytics. The awardees will work closely with RENCI technical staff members and will have access to RENCI resources, including the facilities in the Partners I Building on Centennial Campus.</p>

<p>Through the program, RENCI aims to expand the use of advanced visualization tools among NC State researchers, to help research teams take their work to a new level of academic achievement and to set the stage for future research collaborations that can compete for external funding. Participants in the program will be expected to generate concrete results, such as new methods, models, applications or prototypes that can serve as the basis of larger, externally funded projects.</p>

<p>Applications are due Oct. 22, 2010. To see the complete Call for Proposals, including submission guidelines, please <a href="https://www.renci.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/RENCI-at-NCSU-Engagement-Program.pdf" target="_blank">download the CFP</a>.</p>
