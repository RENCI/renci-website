CHAPEL HILL, May 19, 2010--The Fifth International Symposium on Computational Wind Engineering ( CWE2010) will bring more than 300 experts from over 30 countries to Chapel Hill to discuss computational wind engineering issues that impact homeland security, sustainable energy, building design, large bridge design, urban design, mitigation of severe storms, and a host of other issues.

CWE2010 convenes May 23 – 27 at UNC Chapel Hill's Friday Center for Continuing Education and will include workshops, panel discussions, paper presentations, posters, plenary sessions and special events. The symposium is co-hosted by  HYPERLINK "https://www.renci.org" <a href="https://www.renci.org">RENCI</a>, the <a href="http://www.ie.unc.edu" target="_blank">Institute for the Environment at UNC Chapel Hill</a>, and UNC's  <a href="http://hazardscenter.unc.edu/" target="_blank">Center for the Study of Natural Hazards and Disasters</a>.

"The symposium is a chance for computational wind engineers to meet face-to-face and discuss the latest research and technical innovations in wind engineering," said Alan Huber, an adjunct faculty member at the Institute for the Environment and chair of CWE2010. "The discussion is technical, but our work touches on many of society's most important problems, from how to design the best buildings, cars, bridges and wind turbines to understanding how contaminants disperse through the air."

Technical papers to be presented at the conference will discuss computational wind engineering applications related to the dynamics of severe storms, aerial agriculture pest management, transport and dispersion of pollutants and toxins, natural ventilation methods, vehicle aerodynamics, wind loads on buildings, fire modeling, wind interactions with large structures such as bridges and cables, urban environments, wind energy production and effect, and more.

The International Symposium on Computational Wind Engineering is held quadrennially by the <a href="http://www.iawe.org/" target="_blank">International Association for Wind Engineering</a> and the regional wind engineering association in the host country (the  <a href="http://www.aawe.org/" target="_blank">American Association for Wind Engineering</a>).
