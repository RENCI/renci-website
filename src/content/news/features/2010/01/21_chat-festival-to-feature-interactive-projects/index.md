<p>Participants in CHAT (Collaborations: Humanities, Arts &amp; Technology), a digital arts and humanities festival Feb. 16-20, will take part in interactive projects that explore the impact of technology on our lives.</p>

<p>Performances featuring technology also will be part of CHAT, hosted by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and coordinated by its Institute for the Arts and Humanities in the College of Arts and Sciences.<!--more--></p>

<p>Participants can connect with faculty from area universities and technologists who created the projects and performances. The four-day, five-night festival also will feature discussions and workshops involving faculty, participants and representatives of Research Triangle Park companies.</p>

<p>“The institute has cast a wide net in bringing artists, scholars and practitioners to Chapel Hill for this festival,” said John McGowan, Ph.D., Ruel W. Tyson Jr. Distinguished Professor of the Humanities and institute director. “The festival is a showcase for all the exciting work being done right here in North Carolina, with some national and international figures brought in to spice up the mix.”</p>

<p>Projects will feature work by faculty, technologists and students from UNC, Duke and North Carolina State universities, the Renaissance Computing Institute (RENCI) and academic and corporate partners throughout the region. <a href="../">RENCI</a>, a multi-campus, multidisciplinary research center based in Chapel Hill, brings together experts and advanced technologies to seek solutions to complex problems affecting life in North Carolina.</p>

<p>“Artists and humanists have been both fascinated and a bit threatened by the new ways information is now presented,” McGowan said. “We are in a period of flux, with all kinds of experiments. Especially exciting are the collaborative projects that recognize that digital information is dynamic; that the distinction between producer and audience is breaking down, because the users of information are now able to comment on and revise and add to the materials they are given.”</p>

<p>CHAT is open to the public. Visit <a href="http://www.chatfestival2010.com/register.html">http://www.chatfestival2010.com/register.html</a> for registration and fee information. Upon registering, participants will receive advance information by e-mail, all-access passes and times and places for events including the following faculty projects exhibited or performed on the UNC campus:</p>


<ul>
		<li>“The Virtual Performance       Factory” <br />
 A live and virtual simulation of a video game, this project lets audience members move through a performance space and interact with live actors and virtual experiences. Audience members’ actions affect the performance. Game authors will craft narratives for the audience to experience.<br />
 <br />
 Project Leader: Joseph Megel, UNC, communication studies lecturer and artist in  residence.<br />
 Project Team: Allan Maule of Icarus Studios in Cary, liaison and coordinator; Tracy Walker, UNC, project coordinator and research assistant; Rob Hamilton, UNC, communication studies lecturer, technical director and designer; Mark Robinson, UNC, communication studies lecturer and multimedia lab director.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
		<li>“The Bathysphere: Motion       Capture as Art” <br />
 Designed as a virtual underwater opera and interactive game, the Bathysphere features three-dimensional animations and projections on the walls, ceiling and floor of a space, creating under- and above-water worlds. Two motion-capture systems deployed in the space will enhance the atmosphere: Picking up a beach ball, for instance, will cause an octopus to appear, while waving a wand will direct a school of fish around the space. A sound designer will contribute a musical score to round out the Bathysphere experience. For a demonstration of this project in its early stages, visit http://gazette.unc.edu/file.2.html#chat.<br />
 <br />
 Project Leaders: Francesca Talenti, UNC, institute faculty arts fellow (spring 2010) and associate professor of communication studies, and Greg Welch, UNC, research associate professor of computer science.<br />
 Project Team: Herman Towles, UNC, senior research engineer in computer science; John Thomas, UNC, senior research associate in computer science; and UNC undergraduate and graduate students in the computer science department.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
		<li>“Psychasthenia” <br />
 This project explores the game engine as an artistic medium. An interactive experience Psychasthenia involves custom-made sensors and input devices that govern how a user interfaces with a simulated environment. The project will be displayed and accessed in an immersive dome at RENCI’s UNC site. The dome is a video-projection environment with an ultra-wide field of view (160 degrees) that gives a viewer a sense of total immersion. <br />
 <br />
 Project Leader: Joyce Rudinsky, UNC, associate professor of communication studies and RENCI chief domain scientist for digital arts and humanities.<br />
 Project Team: Victoria Szabo, Duke, program director of information science and information studies; Mark Robinson, UNC, communication studies lecturer and multimedia lab director; Jason Coposky, RENCI, senior visualization engineer.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
		<li>“The Architecture of Association” <br />
 Led by a Duke University research team, this project is a large-scale, generative artwork that draws associative links among media elements to form an evolving visual collage. The Architecture of Association creates rich media landscapes from real-time associative processes. The work will use keywords, metadata and custom clustering algorithms to make selections from the databases, bringing associative material into proximity for a particular duration.<br />
 <br />
 Project Leaders: Bill Seaman, Duke, professor in the visual studies program; and Daniel C. Howe, Brown University computer science department, digital artist, researcher and doctoral candidate at New York University’s Media Research Lab.

</ul>
<ul>
		<li>“Festival on the Hill,”       UNC music department <br />
 The department’s contributions to CHAT will serve as this year’s Festival on the Hill, a department event comprising performances, classes, lectures and more, held every other year. Registering for CHAT will not be required to attend Festival on the Hill events, which will be free to the public. Among offerings, to be detailed in later CHAT announcements, will be an electro-acoustic concert on Feb. 16 and a symposium, “The Art and Culture of the DJ,” Feb. 18-19. For more information, visit http://music.unc.edu/calendars/thecalendar.<br />

<ul>
		<li>“Then/Now: 3-D Virtual       Space as Temporal Telescope” <br />
 An interactive digital world representing parts of downtown Raleigh, this interactive space on a computer screen allows viewers to freely explore the virtual downtown while encouraging them to interact with virtual multimedia kiosks featuring archived images, text and audio of historic buildings, spaces and events. These digital kiosks are strategically placed in the same camera location and orientation as the original archived photos, allowing viewers a chance to both see multimedia displays of the past and participate in a new, virtual space.<br />
 <br />
 Project Leaders: Patrick FitzGerald  and graduate student Melissa Church, N. C. State Advanced Media Lab, College of  Design.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
		<li>“Internet Archive of       African-American Performance Art” <br />
 This project team, comprising a UNC faculty member and his graduate seminar, are creating a Web archive of African-American performance art, featuring an online exhibition to support a variety of media, from texts and photographs to audio, video and Web-based artworks. During a two-week visit to campus in fall 2009, New York performance artist Clifford Owens debuted a performance to be archived on the Web site. Owens is slated to return during the festival.<br />
 <br />
 Project Leader: John Bowles, Ph.D., assistant professor of art history<br />
 Collaborator: Clifford Owens, performance artist.<br />
 Project Team: Bowles’ graduate seminar.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
		<li>“The William Blake Archive”<br />
 This federally funded, free Web site of Blake’s poetry and art is based on approximately 5,500 images (two-thirds from illuminated books and one-third from Blake’s paintings, drawings, and engravings) transferred to digital form. Illuminated books are those in which text is supplemented by decorations such as borders and miniature illustrations. The archive is an international public resource that provides unified access to major works of visual and literary art that are highly disparate, widely dispersed and often severely restricted as a result of their value, rarity and extreme fragility.<br />
 <br />
 Project Team: Joseph Viscomi, Ph.D., James G. Kenan Distinguished Professor of English and comparative literature at UNC; Robert Essick, University of California, Riverside; Morris Eaves, University of Rochester</li>
</ul>


<p>Besides these projects, the Carolina Digital Library and Archives in Wilson Library will showcase digital collections. More information is available at http://cdla.unc.edu/index.html?page=portfolio.</p>

<p>Student projects are being chosen and will be announced  closer to the festival.</p>

<p>Community members interested in sampling these projects and more are invited to join a tour from 7-9 p.m. Feb. 17, the CHAT Festival Art Walk. To participate, attendees must be registered for the festival. During the art walk, five venues will feature festival projects for observation, and many of the faculty, students and community artists who created the projects will be on hand to meet and greet.</p>
