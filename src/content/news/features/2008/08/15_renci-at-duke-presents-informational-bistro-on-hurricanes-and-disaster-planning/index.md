<p>The Bistro will focus on disaster research, including collaborations with the state of North Carolina on hurricane and storm surge prediction and disaster planning and mitigation.</p>
<p>“The 2008 Atlantic Basin Hurricane Season runs from June 1 through Nov. 30 and it’s forecasted to be an active season for North Carolina,” said Jessica Proud, RENCI meteorologist and featured speaker for the Bistro session. “In the session, we will discuss the basics and potential dangers of hurricanes, why they form and how RENCI helps the state to deal with them effectively.”</p>
<p>The Bistro will run from noon to 1 p.m. in the RENCI at Duke Center in the OIT Telecommunications Building, 390 Science Drive, suite 106, on Duke’s West Campus in Durham. Lunch will be provided on a first-come first-served basis. The session is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>Other topics to be covered in the Bistro include the National Hurricane Center’s role in warning the public of a tropical threat and RENCI’s weather portal program, NC-FIRST, which helps emergency managers decipher weather data, understand weather threats and choose actions that minimize threats to lives and property caused by extreme weather.</p>
