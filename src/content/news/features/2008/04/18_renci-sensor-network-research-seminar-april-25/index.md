CHAPEL HILL, NC, April 18, 2008 - Sensor network research will be the focus of an informal research seminar at the Renaissance Computing Institute (RENCI) on Friday, April 25. James Horey, a researcher at the University of New Mexico (UNM), will be the speaker. He will present his talk, <em>"Beyond the Lab: Sensor Networks in the Real  World"</em> at 3 p.m. in the Biltmore Conference Room at RENCI (in the new 590  suite).

Sensor network research has evolved in the past few years from abstract discussions to actual hardware and algorithms, resulting in many research projects and contributions such as the TinyOS, a <a title="Free software" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software" target="_blank">free</a> and <a title="Open source software" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_software" target="_blank">open source</a> component-based <a title="Operating system" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system" target="_blank">operating system</a>,  and platform-targeting <a title="Wireless sensor network" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_sensor_network" target="_blank">wireless sensor  networks</a>. Horey's talk will include discussions about research advances needed to create sensor network interfaces, a framework called FUSN that allows developers to construct virtual file system interfaces for sensor networks, and how to derive new methods and systems to help sensor networks transition into the real world.

Horey is a doctoral student in the Department's Scalable Systems Lab in the UMN computer science department. In addition to sensor network programming environments and underlying support systems, Horey's academic interests include operating systems, communications libraries, and programming interfaces.

The seminar is free and open to the public. Interested viewers can participate at the Collaboration Center on the 2nd floor of the Health Sciences Library or RENCI engagement centers through the Access Grid (AG). The presentation will be sent out in Access Grid version 2.4.  To attend, type https://venue.renci.org:9000/Venues/default in your AG Venue client and then enter Meeting Room 1.  For questions about the AG, send email to <a href="mailto:viz@renci.org">viz@renci.org</a>.
