Applications are now being accepted for the 2008 Tuskegee Grid School (TUGS '08) to be held Feb. 6 - 8 at Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, AL.

Undergraduate and graduate students, researchers, educators and professionals in any scientific discipline are eligible to attend. Applicants should have at least intermediate programming skills (one to two semesters in C/C++, Java, Perl or Python) and hands-on experience with UNIX/Linux in a networked environment. Applicants should have a compelling project to which they can apply grid techniques after completing the course.

The application deadline is Jan. 12 and notification of acceptance and financial support will be Jan. 19. The deadline for course and hotel registration is Jan. 26. The workshop is free for students ($50 refundable deposit required) and costs $50 for all others.

TUGS '08 is sponsored by the Open Science Grid (OSG) and TeraGrid in cooperation with the department of computer science at Tuskegee University and the Computation Institute at the University of Chicago. The workshop will focus on using the OSG and TeraGrid cyberinfrastructure for large-scale computations and data-intensive processing that supports research in a wide range of fields. Participants will learn to use grids comprised of thousands of processors and will be have access to these resources for their own research after completing the course.

Topics to be covered include:
<ul type="square">
 	<li>Concepts, tools, and techniques of grid computing</li>
 	<li>Grid security and program execution</li>
 	<li>Grid scheduling and distributed data management</li>
 	<li>Discovering and using grid resources</li>
 	<li>Techniques for workflow and collaboration</li>
 	<li>How to build your own OSG grid site</li>
</ul>

<strong>About OSG</strong>

OSG is a consortium of universities, national laboratories, scientific collaborations and software developers dedicated to meeting the ever-growing computing and data management requirements of scientific researchers. Supported by the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science and the National Science Foundation, OSG provides access to its members' independently owned and managed resources through a common grid infrastructure that uses high performance networks to connect computing systems scattered across the country. As leader of engagement activities for OSG, RENCI works with research teams to introduce them to the OSG and its resources and help them develop the skills needed to use the OSG national cyberinfrastructure.
