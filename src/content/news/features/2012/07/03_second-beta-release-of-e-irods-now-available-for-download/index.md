RENCI is pleased to announce the second beta release, version 3.0b2, of the new E-iRODS binary distribution.  This release marks a continued progress toward the first full release of E-iRODS, which will be backed up by extensive unit, functional, and regression testing, running continuously on RENCI's open infrastructure. Support and documentation will also be available.<!--more-->

E-iRODS is the Enterprise version of the integrated Rule-Oriented Data System (iRODS), a data grid infrastructure that allows distributed data to be viewed, shared, and managed as a single collection, with support for metadata and discovery. The technology also provides a powerful framework for implementing distributed data management policies.

The iRODS development community, led by the Data Intensive Cyber Environments (DICE) group at UNC-Chapel Hill’s School of Information and Library Science, has developed a robust, feature-rich, and sophisticated codebase. Through federal grants and contributions from the open source community, the iRODS technology is on the cutting edge of developing new approaches for managing data through policy-driven mechanisms.

E-iRODS is a complementary branch of iRODS aimed at supporting production deployments of the iRODS technology. The E-iRODS branch focuses on providing hardened binary distributions with dynamic configurability, and extensive unit, functional, regression and system-level testing to assure reliability of the software.

The 3.0b2 release of E-iRODS is available for download as four different packages across three platforms. To download version 3.0b2, please visit the E-IRODS website.
