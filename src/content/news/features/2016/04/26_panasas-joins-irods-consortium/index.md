SUNNYVALE, Calif. – April 26, 2016 – [Panasas](http://www.panasas.com/)<sup>®</sup>, the leader in performance scale-out network-attached storage (NAS), today announced that it has joined the [iRODS Consortium](http://irods.org/) as a contributing member. The iRODS Consortium leads development and support of the Integrated Rule-Oriented Data System (iRODS), free open source software for data discovery, workflow automation, secure collaboration, and data virtualization. The consortium and the iRODS development team are located at the Renaissance Computing Institute (RENCI) at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.

The world's top researchers in life sciences, geosciences, and information management use iRODS to control their data in thousands of locations worldwide. Panasas will contribute insights into performance scale-out NAS requirements for supporting instrumentation and bioinformatics workloads.

"We look forward to the addition of Panasas and their performance scale-out NAS platform to the iRODS ecosystem," said Dan Bedard, director of the iRODS Consortium. "As the newest iRODS Consortium member and already an enthusiastic contributor to the iRODS technology base, Panasas will play a valuable and exciting role in the continued evolution of iRODS data management and the iRODS Consortium that drives its development and support."

Panasas drives industry and research innovation by accelerating workflows and simplifying data management with [ActiveStor<sup>®</sup>](http://www.panasas.com/products/activestor-16-18), a fully integrated performance scale-out NAS solution. ActiveStor leverages the patented [PanFS](http://www.panasas.com/products/panfs)<sup>®</sup> file system and the [DirectFlow](http://www.panasas.com/products/panfs/network-protocols)<sup>®</sup> parallel data access protocol to deliver data that is accessible, secure, and easily managed. Industry standard NFS and SMB protocols are also supported. In addition, Panasas achieves exceptional data-protection with modern erasure-coding methods that allow reliability to scale with capacity.

"We are looking forward to working with iRODS and its Technology Working Group members to drive storage technology development that accelerates the discovery and collaboration of medical solutions by research institutions worldwide," said Jim Donovan, chief marketing and sales officer at Panasas.
