The data science community and members of the South Big Data Hub should mark their calendars for the very first Southern Data Science Conference, to be held on April 7 at the Hyatt Regency Atlanta Perimeter at Villa Christina. The conference is expected to attract data science thought leaders from around the southeast and the nation and will feature speakers from innovative companies and research laboratories, such as Google, Microsoft, AT&T, NASA, Glassdoor and Groupon.

Those who attend the conference will learn about data science best practices and cutting-edge technologies that are transforming data science and analytics into a game-changing domain that spans business, academia and government. Conference speakers will cover topics ranging from data science fundamentals to building hands-on data science solutions to solve real-world problems in areas such as fraud detection, cybersecurity, relevant search and recommendations, and many others.

The conference also will be the first to host three authors of respected books on data science: Joel Grus author of _Data Science from Scratch_; Michael Brzustowicz, author of _Data Science with Java;_ and Trey Grainger author of _Solr in Action_.

Registering early will translate into money saved. The conference offers a $75 early bird discount to those who register by Feb. 15 and will provide an additional 15 percent discount to South Big Data Hub members. Organizations that register a group of five or more attendees will be eligible for a company pass that provides a 20 percent discount by using the discount code SBDHUB2017.
