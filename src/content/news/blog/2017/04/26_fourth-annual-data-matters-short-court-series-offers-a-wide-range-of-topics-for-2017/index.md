Calling all researchers who manage, share, analyze and archive large or complicated data sets, business professionals struggling to stay afloat in the data deluge, data analysts looking to sharpen their skills, and students interested in the hot field of data science. The five-day Data Matters Short Course series is here to help and give you the knowledge you need to thrive in our data rich world.

Now in its fourth year, Data Matters is sponsored by the [National Consortium for Data Science](http://datascienceconsortium.org/) (NCDS) the [Data Science Initiative](https://research.ncsu.edu/dsi/) at NC State University, the [Odum Institute](http://odum.unc.edu/) for Research in Social Science at UNC Chapel Hill, and [RENCI](https://renci.org/).

This year's Data Matters will be held August 7-11 at the James B. Hunt Jr. Library on NC State's Centennial Campus.

Data Matters will feature courses on topics such as using the R software environment, machine learning, and geospatial analytics. Participants can register for up to three classes, including two-day courses held on Monday/Tuesday and Thursday/Friday and one-day courses held on Wednesday. Course instructors include field experts from UNC Greensboro, NC State, UNC-Chapel Hill, UNCâ€™s Odum Institute, Arizona State University, RENCI and Duke University. Faculty students and staff with academic institutions can register for the entire week for the reduced price of $275. Participants who work for NCDS member organizations also are eligible for discounts.
