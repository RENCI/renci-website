The 2018 Southern Data Science Conference (SDSC 18) will bring experts and researchers from top companies and research institutes to Atlanta on April 13 and 14 for two days of sharing best practices and discussing the latest issues, challenges, and trends in data science.

The South Big Data Hub is one of the sponsors of the conference, which is expected to attract more than 300 general attendees, 50-plus research attendees, and at least 30 speakers. Other conference sponsors are [DataRobot](https://www.datarobot.com/), [Arcadis](https://www.arcadis.com/en/united-states/), [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/), and the [National Consortium for Data Science](http://www.datascienceconsortium.org/) (NCDS). South Hub Co-Executive Director Lea Shanley serves on the advisory board and will be one of the conference speakers.

SDSC 18 is the second annual Southern Data Science Conference and this year, a research track has been added, where academics and students from top research institutions will share their work during a poster session. The research track aims to bridge the gaps between data scientists in industry, academia, and government. The research poster session will give graduate students and academic researchers the chance to present their ongoing work to industry leaders, and will provide industry attendees the opportunity to recruit new talent or form new collaborations.

Researchers whose posters are accepted for the conference will have their registration fees paid by the NCDS. In addition, the NCDS will present prizes to the three best posters as selected by the conference program committee. Poster submissions are due Jan. 26 and can be submitted [here](https://www.southerndatascience.com/submission-guidline).

Keynote addresses will be presented by Kirk Borne, principal data scientist at Booz Allen Hamilton; and Jane Eggers, CEO of Nara Logics. Other speakers represent some of the biggest names in the technology and data science sectors, including Google, Facebook, Uber, Intel, and Microsoft.

Registration is now open and early-bird discounts are available through Feb. 28\. Discounts are also available for students. To learn more or to register, visit the [Southern Data Science Conference website](https://www.southerndatascience.com/).
