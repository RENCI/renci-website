<p>RENCI collaborations are winning awards all over! The Research, Engagement, and Capabilities Hub of North Carolina (REACH NC) was recently selected as a finalist in the University Economic Development Association\u2019s (<a href="http://universityeda.org">UEDA</a>) 2013 Awards of Excellence competition, in the Leadership &amp; Collaboration category.</p>
<p>REACH NC is a searchable Web-based tool that allows scientists, academics, researchers and the business community to access profiles of experts at universities and research organizations across the state, in order to find people and resources needed to build research teams or to provide expert advice. The web interface compiles data from research publications, research grant awards and other sources to make it easier for faculty, university administrators, government agencies and the public to discover people with a particular expertise.</p>
<p>The REACH NC team, includes Sharlini Sankaran (REACH NC Executive Director) and \u00a0Monica Schledorn, who work closely with David Knowles, RENCI&#8217;s director of engagement and economic development. RENCI data experts built the data backbone for REACH NC and developed protocols for user access and data management and storage. RENCI staff also designed and implemented the Web front end for the tool.\u00a0Hong Yi, a RENCI senior research software developer, created information visualizations that group experts by their areas of expertise and professional backgrounds.</p>
<p>Sankaran will give a presentation on the project at the UEDA Annual Summit in Pittsburgh in October. Summit participants will evaluate the finalists and select a winner in each award category.</p>
<p>We wish our team all the best of luck!</p>
