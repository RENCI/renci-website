<p>As we delve further into the era of large-scale computing, new and ever-more challenging problems present themselves for solving. Google Fellow, Luiz Andre Barroso, will be coming to Duke University on Nov. 18, 2013 to deliver a lecture entitled \u201cThree Hard Problems in Large-Scale Computing\u201d where he will present three examples of these types of problems, drawn from his experience with operating large computing systems at Google.<\/p>
<p>Dr. Barroso\u2019s interests cover a wide variety of technical topics, from distributed systems software to computing platform design. He co-wrote <em>The Datacenter as a Computer<\/em>, the first textbook to describe the architecture of warehouse-scale computing systems, as well as a National Academies Report entitled \u201cThe Future of Computing Performance: Game Over or Next Level?\u201d. He received his B.S. and M.S. in Electrical Engineering from the Pontificia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and his Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from the University of Southern California. Dr. Barroso is an ACM Fellow and AAAS Fellow and serves on the National Academies&#8217; Computer Science and Telecommunications Board.<\/p>
<p>The lecture will take place from 4:00-5:00pm at North 311 at Duke. The event is part of the Triangle Computer Science Distinguished Lecturer Series. Contact Alvin R. Lebeck at <a href="https:\/\/webmail.renci.org\/OWA\/redir.aspx?C=y4bENGTWHUygGMLeCB51pBxCotmXr9AIutB4_Mtmj2klALJJ-33hKOlwZvGGLAO9T4IeJr4mmPE.&amp;URL=mailto%3aalvy%40cs.duke.edu">alvy@cs.duke.edu<\/a> directly for scheduling or questions.<\/p>
