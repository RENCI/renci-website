<p>RENCI&#8217;s Sharlini Sankaran, the Executive Director of REACH NC, will be speaking about the program on UNC-TV on October 16 at 3:15 p.m. She will be speaking about what \u00a0REACH NC is and why it is important.</p>
<p>The REACH NC program\u00a0began as a way to allow North Carolina to tap into its own pool of experts and resources.\u00a0It uses RENCI-developed technology to create a Web portal that enables users to search, browse and find thousands of experts and assets within North Carolina higher education and research institutions. REACH NC\u2019s expert profiles can assist people in industry, community groups and university personnel in efforts to find information and potential collaborators for research and problem-solving.</p>
<p>Sharlini will also be explaining how the REACH NC system works and give some examples of success stories to illustrate to viewers how important this system is.</p>
