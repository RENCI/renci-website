  The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) launched the Biomedical Data Translator program in October 2016 in an effort to overcome data science challenges in biomedical research. The Data Translator project applies semantic integration strategies to share chemical, genetic, phenotypic, disease, ontological, and other knowledge sources to form a technology platform for translational science.  This knowledge is integrated together into a knowledge graph, which is then analyzed to produce novel insights and enhance human reasoning.

  The NCATS Data Translator consists of Knowledge Providers (KPs) that ingest a wide variety of biomedical information, analyze it, and provide it to the Translator ecosystem through standard interfaces.  Autonomous Relay Agents (ARAs) then integrate information across KPs and answer user’s questions based on that information.  These questions can range from “What is the mechanism of action of famotidine?” to “Suggest novel genes that may modify asthma” to “What are some novel treatments that could reduce the symptoms of primary ciliary dyskinesia?”
  
  RENCI contributes to the full spectrum of Translator activities.   
  
  Clinical data holds tremendous promise as a source of both novel observations and real-world evidence, but it typically only describes a patient’s interactions with the healthcare system, and ignores the role that environment plays in their disease.  Furthermore, to protect patient privacy, clinical data can rarely be exposed.  To surmount these challenges, RENCI and NC TRACS have developed ICEES+, a disease-agnostic framework and approach for openly exposing clinical data that have been integrated at the patient- and visit-level with environmental exposures data (include links to the API and github).  

  In order to understand the mechanisms of diseases and treatments, researchers must think causally; biomedical entities are related through a chain of events that can lead either to positive or negative outcomes.  RENCI researchers, along with partners at RTI,  have created a framework for providing Causal Activity Models (CAMs), representing and presenting knowledge as a sequence of biological events at scales ranging from receptor binding to adverse clinical outcomes (links to API & github).

  Translator uses ARAs to integrate information across KPs and reason over it to provide responsive answers, along with the evidence for those answers, as well as the provenance of the information used.  ARAGORN is a second-generation reasoner based on , that applies novel approaches to interpret user questions, assemble federated data, find suitable responses, and assemble those responses into high-level descriptions for a user.

  Finally, RENCI, along with OSU and LBLN, co-leads the Translator Standards and Reference Implementation group, which produces a suite of standards and products, a model for their governance, and processes to coordinate integration and shared implementation.   Examples of products include shared tools to coordinate the use of identifiers and ontologies, tools to aid teams in exposing data using Translator standards, and shared documentation outlining guidance on the Translator system.
