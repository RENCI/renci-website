renciRole: !markdown |
  Man to Molecule to Man, or M^3, seeks to identify novel drug uses through a pipeline that incorporates data on the relationships between drugs and their side effects (extracted from social media and various health forums), quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling data, and knowledge bases on chemical-biological and entity-disease relationships.  
 
  The UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy leads the project. RENCI focuses on text mining assistance and on building the cyberinfrastructure that will bridge queries across multiple knowledge sources.
