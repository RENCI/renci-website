  ROBOKOP (Reasoning Over Biomedical Objects linked in Knowledge-Oriented Pathways) is a reasoning tool that uses a knowledge graph to answer translational science questions such as “why does the use of common degreasers correlate with incidence of ulcerative colitis?”  Users pose questions as a graph query using a graphical interface, and results are returned from ROBOKOP’s 10 million node graph, ranked by their evidentiary support.

  As part of the feasibility phase of the [Biomedical Data Translator](https://ncats.nih.gov/translator), RENCI and its collaborators at CoVar created ROBOKOP. ROBOKOP aims to address, in a fully automated way, user queries that can be answered by reasoning across knowledge sources by means of a knowledge graph.
 
  ROBOKOP’s knowledge graph (https://robokopkg.renci.org) is a collection of biologically relevant entities such as genes, diseases, chemicals, and anatomical features.  Nodes in the graph represent these entities, while edges in the graph represent relationships between those entities, such as a gene’s involvement in a disease, or a chemical’s effect on a gene.  The ROBOKOP KG is assembled from more than 30 data sources; it consists of over 10 million nodes and 250 million edges.  

  ROBOKOP can respond to arbitrary graph queries across biomedical topics. Users can thus browse existing questions and answer sets or posit new questions to create new answer sets. Using ROBOKOP’s graphical interface, users can ask questions such as “Why is sickle cell disease protective against malaria?” “How does isopropyl alcohol treat chronic vomiting disease?”  ROBOKOP then locates putative answers and ranks them according to an algorithm that factors in evidence from the literature; and allows users to interact with the knowledge graph to view the results and supporting evidence (i.e. PubMed literature citations).
