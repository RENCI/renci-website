  The Surgical Critical Care Initiative (SC2i) processes data from studies at world-class civilian and military research hospitals to create clinical decision-support tools that focus clinicians on the best choices for each patient.

  Improving critical-care decisions can save lives and improve recovery. To support the SC2i initiative, RENCI leads the development of a relational database model for a Clinical Data Repository (CDR) and a system to give program managers more direct access to their data.
 
  Along with collaborators at Duke Clinical Research Institute and other SC2i contributors, the RENCI team assists in defining the goals and requirements to integrate the CDR into SC2i, as well as in the design of the CDR platform, in particular the deployment of CDR in Amazon GovCloud and workflows for data movement to and from GovCloud. RENCI manages the security aspects of the SC2i CDR deployment and develops the data management methods for federating the diversity of data sources required for the CDR.
