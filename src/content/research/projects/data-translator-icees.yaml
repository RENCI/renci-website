  The ICEES+ Knowledge Provider is an initiative of the Biomedical Data Translator program that provides a regulatory-compliant framework for sharing linked clinical data and information on environmental exposures. ICEES is currently being used to support our driving use case on asthma and ask questions such as are there racial disparities in the impact of exposure to airborne pollutants on asthma?

  Researchers face numerous regulatory, cultural, and technical challenges when sharing clinical data or any data containing personally identifiable information. RENCI leads the Exposures Provider team of the Biomedical Data Translator program, which also includes the North Carolina Translational and Clinical Sciences (NC TraCS) Institute, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), University of North Carolina School of Medicine and other departments at UNC Chapel Hill. This team has developed ICEES (Integrated Clinical and Environmental Exposures Service) as a regulatory-compliant framework and approach for openly sharing integrated clinical and environmental exposures data.
 
  ICEES is currently being used to support a driving use case on asthma. This use case asks questions about racial disparities in the impact of exposure to airborne pollutants, outcomes associated with various asthma medications, and how socioeconomic factors interact with airborne exposures to influence rates of asthma-related emergency department visits. In addition, ICEES is being adapted to expose data for several new conditions and data types through collaborations with investigators at the NIEHS Environmental Polymorphisms Registry, UNC Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia Registry, and the National Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network.
