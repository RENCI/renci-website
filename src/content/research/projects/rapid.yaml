  This NSF-funded RAPID effort is a collaborative research project focused on building digital infrastructure and communities to assess drinking water hazards caused by hurricanes. The project will develop and host two workshops, one with relevant stakeholders from  Puerto Rico and one with relevant stakeholders from North Carolina. In addition to facilitating the North Carolina workshop, RENCI is providing expertise on cyberinfrastructure, data curation, and collaborative science.

  During hurricanes, flooding and damage to infrastructure can compromise drinking water supplies and cause contamination. RAPID, which grew out of prior efforts related to Hurricane Maria in 2017 and was initiated after Hurricane Florence hit the Carolinas in 2018, aims to increase access to post-hurricane water quality data through access to cyberinfrastructure, capacity development, and community-building among groups focused on post-disaster water quality issues.

  The project is creating two of workshops with accompanying activities aimed at accelerating research through network-to-network collaborations, data needs and availability assessment, data collection, and educational activities focused on data curation and cyberinfrastructure. RENCI is responsible for facilitating a workshop in North Carolina workshop, providing access to its hydrologic research platform [HydroShare](https://www.hydroshare.org/), and contributing data curation and community-building expertise.
