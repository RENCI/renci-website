description: >
  The NCATS Data Translator is based on integrating data from disparate sources, so that it can be used together to enhance human reasoning.  This lofty goal must rest on a solid foundation of standards;   in order to integrate data, the cross-institutional Translator team must coalesce around standards of data representation, message formats, API definitions, and change management.  The Standards and Reference Implementations (SRI) team helps guide the consortium members towards agreements on these standards.

  Along with collaborators from Oregon State University and Lawrence Berkeley National Labs, RENCI co-leads the Standards and Reference Implementations team for Data Translator.  This group is responsible for producing a suite of standards and products, a model for their governance, and processes to coordinate integration and shared implementation.
   
  Architecture and API specifications drive community efforts to define details of project architecture [link arch github] and communication protocols [link trapi github] program components, while shared data models [link biolink github] will define the standard entity types, relationship types, and a schema shared by all Translator components. Integrated reference ontologies will provide compliant terms and relationships. A continually-updated knowledge graph and data lake will provide Translator with a standardized and integrated global view of the whole information landscape. 

  In addition to guiding standards development, the SRI creates shared tools to overcome integration barriers between Translator components, or to provide reference implementations of various standards.  For instance, the node normalizer [link] allows Translator components to recognize when the same concept is represented in different vocabularies, making integration across those vocabularies simple.
