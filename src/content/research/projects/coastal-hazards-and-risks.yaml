  RENCI develops systems to support fundamental research, engineering design, and hazard assessments related to coastal hazards such as storm surge using the ADCIRC storm surge model.

  Improving the ability to understand and predict storm surge—a primary cause of coastal flooding during hurricanes and storms—helps guide decisions that protect people and property.  

  RENCI operates the North Carolina Forecast System, an advanced, automated computational system that runs in near real-time during active tropical cyclones that threaten any part of the U.S. East and Gulf of Mexico coasts. The outputs are publicly disseminated through the [Coastal Emergency Risk Assessment](http://coastalrisk.live/) website.  

  The system is based on the Adcirc Surge Guidance System (ASGS), which combines RENCI-developed storm surge and wave models [ADCIRC](http://adcirc.org/) and unSWAN with atmospheric prediction models including the National Centers for Environmental Prediction’s operational weather forecasting model and tropical cyclone forecast advisories from the National Hurricane Center. 

  The ADCIRC model is used for fundamental research in coastal oceanography, engineering and flood protection design studies, and for coastal hazard assessments for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)’s National Flood Insurance Program. Storm surge applications and projects based on ADCIRC and related software include:

  - Surrogate models and database approaches for large FEMA storm surge studies (current, FEMA-funded)
  - Data assimilation methods for the ADCIRC Prediction System [http:adcircprediction.org] (current, current NOPP funded) 
  - APSViz - A modern approach to visualization of ADCIRC’s unstructured model output (current, FEMA_funded)
  - Techniques for coupling ADCIRC to hydraulic/hydrological models (current, NOAA-funded)
  - CIVIC - NSF-funded initiative to investigate academic research potential for commercialization.  
  - Data access and visualization of storm surge models for NOAA’S National Hurricane Center (completed)
  - Modeling of storm surge and risk-based evacuation routes along the North Carolina coast (completed)
  - Storm surge hazard assessment for New Jersey wastewater facilities (completed)
  - Modeling to support the North Carolina Sea Level Rise Impacts Study (completed)
