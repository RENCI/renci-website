  A winner of UNC-Chapel Hill’s Creativity Hubs Initiative, “Heterogeneity in Obesity: Transdisciplinary Approaches for Precision Research and Treatment” is focused on understanding why two people with the same diets and exercise equally can have very different susceptibility to weight gain, with the aim of developing treatment approaches that go far beyond the typical “one-size-fits-all” approach. The project, called Obesity Hub, involves 27 faculty members from 16 departments, six schools, and five centers and institutes.

  RENCI serves in a leadership role on the project and works to apply its Biomedical Data Translator tools to help researchers access and analyze Obesity Hub data. Statistical results from genetic and metabolomic studies of obesity are integrated with the ROBOKOP knowledge graph representing prior biomedical knowledge.  Explanatory subgraphs linking novel observations and prior knowledge place the novel results in the context of previous information.   The ROBOKOP graph also serves linkages between results from the mouse models and those from human cohorts.
