  The BRAIN-I collaboration seeks to make high-resolution microscopy images of the brain easy to store, share, and analyze in support of neuroscience research.

  BRAIN-I is a collaboration between RENCI and neuroscientists at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The project uses RENCI’s HeLx framework to make high resolution microscopy images more manageable, shareable, and usable for research. It also uses RENCI’s integrated Rule Oriented Data System ([iRODS](/projects/irods)) to allow researchers to apply data management policies specific to their lab and research project while keeping the data secure.
   
  The computational analysis takes place on a RENCI Kubernetes cluster. Among the cluster nodes is a high performance computing system equipped with three Nvidia Tesla graphical processing units (GPUs), which greatly speeds up the time of data processing. The HeLx environment allows users to dynamically launch data science tools including image visualization workspaces. These workspaces run entirely in a browser while presenting the most advanced, hardware accelerated visualization systems. The BRAIN-I system takes the 3D microscopy images and replicates that data onto a server at RENCI that runs iRODS.
   
  Ultimately, the project will allow researchers to upload massive image files into the BRAIN-I system in order to view, share and analyze those images using Deep Learning methods, track and understand the origins of the data, and make the images and related analysis data discoverable to researchers at UNC and elsewhere.
