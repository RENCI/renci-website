description: DISTINCT aims to develop a highly resilient, fault-tolerant, and reliable distributed network control system for tomorrow's power grids using cutting-edge emerging technologies, such as cloud computing and software defined networks. The merit of this research lies in the proposed multidisciplinary and cross-layer approach to address the challenges in developing distributed smart grids and cyberphysical systems.

  This project aims to develop a transformative distributed networked control system for wide-area power grid systems. RENCI is one of three collaborating institutions, along with North Carolina State University and the University of South Florida. The project uses the RENCI-developed [ExoGENI](http://www.exogeni.net/) testbed.
